fix pdb format
	- The pdb format written by polys does not 
          confirm to the standard. This confuses the
          viewing programs. 

fix timestamp
    - current format is 192010

handle unused return values
    - for now I stored them in an 'int unused;' variable, but this
      return value should be checked.
