POLYS 2.0: An open source software package for building three-dimensional structures of polysaccharides
=========================================
This repository is a reconstruction.

POLYS 2.0 was originally published on Bitbucket,
and announced in the journal Biopolymers [1].

The article points to a mercurial repository [2],
which does not exist anymore.

The initial commit here, is my most recent snapshot 
of the original POLYS 2.0 mercurial repository.
