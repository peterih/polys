Dependencies: flex, bison, gcc, make

The package 'build-essential' is needed on some Debian systems.

Polys currently installs itself in the source code directory. 
It can be compiled by simply using:

make all

Before POLYS will generate any output the environment variables
POLYS_DIR and MONOBANK_DIR should be set.

If e.g. you are using bash, put these lines in .bashrc
export POLYS_DIR=/home/USER/PATH_TO/polys
export MONOBANK_DIR=/home/USER/PATH_TO/polys/mono
export PATH=${PATH}:/home/USER/PATH_TO/polys

Advanced
--------

Should you decide to modify the parser, a couple more steps is 
required to compile Polys.

flex -l polylex
bison -d polypars

make all

Q. I get the build error "/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lfl"
A. Your system does not have Flex installed.
