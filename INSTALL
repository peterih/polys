Dependencies: flex

Polys currently installs itself in the source code directory. 
It can be compiled by simply using:

make all

Before POLYS will generate any output the environment variables
POLYS_DIR and MONOBANK_DIR should be set.

Advanced

Should you decide to modify the parser, a couple more steps is 
required to compile Polys.

flex -l polylex
bison -d polypars

make all
